# React

## 1. What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** created by **Jordan Walke at Facebook**.

- A tool for building **UI components** and **web applications**.
- Promotes **reusable components**, like Lego blocks.
- Helps write **significantly lesser code** by handling UI logic efficiently.

## 2. History of React

- **2011** â€“ Early prototype of React was created.
- **2012** â€“ Jordan Walke developed the prototype further.
- **2013** â€“ React was **launched** and **open-sourced**.
- **2014** â€“ Rapid **expansion** and adoption of React began.
- **2015** â€“ React became **stable** and widely used.

## 3. How React Works?

Traditionally, when data changes, developers had to **manually manipulate the DOM**, often leading to **full page reloads**.

React takes a different approach by enabling you to build **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**.

### Key Concepts:

- **SPA** loads a single HTML document on the first request.
- Then, it updates only the parts of the webpage that need to change using **JavaScript**.
- This is called **Client-Side Routing**.

### Benefits:

- No full page reloads when navigating.
- React **intercepts requests** and updates only what's necessary.
- Leads to **better performance** and a **dynamic user experience**.
