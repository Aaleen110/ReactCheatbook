# React

## 1. What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** created by **Jordan Walke at Facebook**.

- A tool for building **UI components** and **web applications**.
- Promotes **reusable components**, like Lego blocks.
- Helps write **significantly lesser code** by handling UI logic efficiently.

---

## 2. History of React

- **2011** – Early prototype of React was created.
- **2012** – Jordan Walke developed the prototype further.
- **2013** – React was **launched** and **open-sourced**.
- **2014** – Rapid **expansion** and adoption of React began.
- **2015** – React became **stable** and widely used.

---

## 3. How React Works?

Traditionally, when data changes, developers had to **manually manipulate the DOM**, often leading to **full page reloads**.

React takes a different approach by enabling you to build **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**.

### Key Concepts:

- **SPA** loads a single HTML document on the first request.
- Then, it updates only the parts of the webpage that need to change using **JavaScript**.
- This is called **Client-Side Routing**.

### Benefits:

- No full page reloads when navigating.
- React **intercepts requests** and updates only what's necessary.
- Leads to **better performance** and a **dynamic user experience**.

> 🚀 React revolutionized front-end development with its component-based architecture and virtual DOM optimization.

---

## 4. Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM, used by React to optimize UI updates and improve performance.

### What is Virtual DOM?
It's a JavaScript representation of real DOM elements, their properties, and attributes.
React creates and maintains a Virtual DOM tree that mirrors the actual DOM.
Whenever data changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first instead of touching the real DOM immediately.

### How It Works:
Re-render on State Change
React re-renders the Virtual DOM whenever there’s a state or prop change.

### Reconciliation
React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the new one to identify what has changed.

### Batched Updates
Instead of updating the DOM after every single change, React batches multiple changes and applies them together.

### Minimal DOM Updates
React calculates the least expensive way to update the real DOM using the diffed changes.

### Benefits:
- Reduces costly direct DOM manipulations.
- Improves performance by limiting updates to only necessary parts.
- Makes UI updates smooth and efficient, even in large applications.

### Not Just React:
The Virtual DOM is not exclusive to React.
Frameworks like Vue.js also use Virtual DOM concepts to boost performance and streamline rendering.

## 5. Advantages and Disadvantages of React

### ✅ Advantages
1. **Easy to Learn and Use** – React has a simple learning curve, especially for those with JavaScript knowledge.  
2. **Code Reusability** – Components can be reused across different parts of an application.  
3. **Improved Performance** – Virtual DOM optimizes rendering and improves performance.  
4. **Large Community Support** – Rich ecosystem and support with extensive libraries and tools.  
5. **JavaScript-Based** – Leverages the full power of JavaScript for building UI.  
6. **Cross-Platform (Mobile + Web)** – React Native allows code sharing between web and mobile apps.

### ❌ Disadvantages
1. **High Pace of Development** – Frequent updates can be hard to keep up with.  
2. **JSX** – Mixing HTML with JavaScript can be confusing for new developers.  
3. **Learning Curve** – Concepts like JSX, hooks, and state management require time to master.

---

## 6. States and Props

In React, **states** and **props** are two fundamental concepts that allow components to manage and pass data.

### 🟢 State
- Represents the internal data of a component.
- A JavaScript object that stores dynamic values.
- Managed using the `useState` hook (in functional components) or `this.state` (in class components).
- Ideal for data that is **mutable** and specific to the component.

### 🟣 Props
- Short for **properties**.
- Used to pass data from a **parent** component to a **child** component.
- **Immutable** – cannot be modified by child components.
- Enables component **reusability**, as different values can be passed to the same component.
- Accessed in the child component via the `props` object.

---

## 7. Class-based and Function-based Components in React
📦 Class-based Components
Extend from the React.Component base class.

Use a render() method to return the component's JSX representation.

Have access to lifecycle methods like:
componentDidMount
componentWillMount
shouldComponentUpdate
etc.

⚡ Function-based Components
Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
More lightweight and concise compared to class-based components.
Since React 16.8 (Feb 2019), with the introduction of Hooks, functional components can:
Maintain state using useState
Perform side effects using useEffect
Use other hooks like useContext, useReducer, etc.

Benefits:
Simple syntax
Better reusability
Lesser boilerplate code

---

## 8. React Component Lifecycle
React components go through several lifecycle phases: Mounting, Updating, Unmounting, and Error Handling.

### 🟢 MOUNTING
Mounting refers to putting elements into the DOM. There are 4 built-in methods called in this order:

**constructor()**

First method called when the component is initiated.
Used to initialize state and bind methods.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
Invoked right before rendering.
Enables the component to update its internal state in response to prop changes.
Returns an object to update the state, or null to do nothing.

**render()**

Returns the JSX that represents the component UI.

**componentDidMount()**
Called after the component is rendered in the DOM.

Commonly used for:
Fetching data
Adding event listeners
Subscriptions

### 🔁 UPDATING

Updating happens when props or state change. The lifecycle methods involved are:

**static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)**

Called again when component receives new props.

**shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**

Determines if the component should re-render.
Returns a boolean (default is true).
Useful for performance optimization.

**render()**

Called again to re-render UI based on new state/props.

**getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**

Called before the DOM is updated.
Use case: capturing scroll position.

**componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**

Called after the component is updated in the DOM.
Ideal for performing side effects in response to prop/state changes.

### 🔻 UNMOUNTING
**componentWillUnmount()**

Called just before the component is removed from the DOM.
Used for cleanup tasks such as:
Removing event listeners
Cancelling timers
Unsubscribing from services

### ❌ ERROR HANDLING
**componentDidCatch(error, info)**

Called when an error occurs during rendering or in lifecycle methods.
Enables displaying fallback UI and logging errors gracefully.


## 9. Controlled and Uncontrolled Components

## Controlled Components

Controlled components are components that have their **state** and **behaviour** controlled by the parent component. These components rely on **props** passed down by their parent components to update their state and behaviour.

## Uncontrolled Components

Uncontrolled components manage their own **state** internally, without relying on the parent component to control or update their state. They are often used when you want to avoid passing too many props down the component tree.

## 10. Context API

Context provides a way to share data between components without having to pass it explicitly through **props**. It allows you to create a **global state** or share **data and functions** that can be accessed by components within the given context.

---

## Creating a Context

You create a context using the `React.createContext()` function. This returns an object with two components:

- **Provider** – used to provide the context value.
- **Consumer** – used to consume the context value.

```jsx
const MyContext = React.createContext();
```

Providing Data
Wrap the components that need access to the context with the Provider component. The Provider accepts a value prop that contains the data you want to share.

```jsx
<MyContext.Provider value={/* value to be shared */}>
  {/* Components that need access to the context */}
</MyContext.Provider>
```

Consuming Data
There are two ways to consume context data in a component:

Using the Consumer Component

```jsx

<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => (
    // Render based on the context value
  )}
</MyContext.Consumer>

```

Using the useContext Hook
This is the recommended approach in functional components:

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```
